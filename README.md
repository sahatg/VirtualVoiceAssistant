## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Python**: Version 3.8 to 3.11 (download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or 11.
- **Microphone**: For voice input.
- **Google Chrome**: Recommended for browser control (optional, but preferred).

### Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to set up and run the Voice Assistant:

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/VoiceAssistantProject.git
cd VoiceAssistantProject

# Step 2: Verify Python installation
python --version

# Step 3: Install all dependencies in one go
pip install speechrecognition pyautogui pygetwindow pystray pillow

# Step 4: Run the assistant
python main.py

Notes
If "pip is not recognized", ensure Python is added to your system PATH or run:
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

- speechrecognition: Handles voice input.
- pyautogui: Automates browser interactions.
- pygetwindow: Manages windows.
- pystray: Enables system tray functionality.
- pillow: Processes images (e.g., tray icon).

Building an Executable (Optional)
To create a standalone .exe file, run the following commands:
# Step 1: Install PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller

# Step 2: Build the executable
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --add-data "assistant_icon.ico;." --add-data "assistant_logo.png;." --icon=assistant_icon.ico main.py
- Output: main.exe will be generated in the dist/ folder (approximately 50 MB).
- Note: Ensure assistant_icon.ico and assistant_logo.png are in the project folder, or remove those flags if not used.

Usage üìñ
